Graph: Adjacency and connection should be there.there should be root or path.
It is combination of vertex and egdes
types:
1.undirected graph(with and without weight)
2.directed graph(with and without weight)
3.weight graph
Representation of graph:
......list of edges
.......adjacency list
........adjacency matrix

BFS: In breadth first search visit a node and then move onto visit all adjacent vertices.
DFS:In dfs after visiting a node select one adjacent vertice and explore it completely move on with other vertex.

DIJKSTRAS ALGORITHM:
It comes under greedy method where the solution for the given problem will be figured out stage by stage.
dijkstra algorithm helps you to find out shortest path from one vertex to all the other vertices.
Drawback:
If weight of any edge is a -ve number.dijkstra won't work for that.
