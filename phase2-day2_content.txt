polymorphism:one item or same item used for different purposes.
two types:
1)overloading
a.operator overloading
b.mehod overloading
2)overriding:using same+ symbol for both addition and concatenation

#operator overloading:using a symbol for mathematical operations.
#method overloading:using a symbol for methods like concatenation using + symbol.
overriding:if a method is defective or canot be used inside aderived class it will take it from its base class or parent class.

--------------------------------------------DATA STRUCTURES--------------------------------------------------------------
Linkedlist,graph,tree more important
--helps to write efficient programs
--linear-array/linked list/stack/queue/matrix
--nonlinear-binarytree/heap/hashtable/graph
linear-storing data sequentially
nonlinear-no sequential style required
special datastructures:list,tuple
Static:array(size cannot be changed) and Dynamic:list,stack,queue
---->Linked list:Train is real time example, as the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list.
types:singly/doubly/circular linked list
---creating linked list:
step1:create the node
step2:partition the node with 2segments data and none
step3:add value into the blank node
step4:mark the node as head
step5:create the next node by following theabove steps
step6:establish the link between 1st and 2nd nodes
DISPLAY LINKEDLIST:Traversal is required from 1st node till tail node in order to display exsisting linked list.
