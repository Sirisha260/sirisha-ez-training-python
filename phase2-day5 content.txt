Types of Trees:
Binary tree: A node can have of maximum of 2 children.
BinaryTree Traversal:
3 types:
1.Inorder:left-root-right(LDR)
2.Preorder:root-left-right(DLR)
3.Postorder:left-right-root(LRD)
2 tpes of treversal:
BFS:Breadth First Search
level order taversal
DFS:Depth first Search . In this we have inorder,preorder,postorder
two types of binary tree:
1.Full binary tree:All nodes will have 0(or) 2 children
2.Pathalogical tree or degenerate tree::All nodes will have 0(or) 1 children
3.skewed tree:it is may be left skewed or right skewed.
....It is having either only left nodes or right nodes
Complete Binary Tree:
.....Every level should be full or complete.
.....In last if it is incomplete nodes should present at extreme left side.
Perfect binary Tree:
...All internal which have 2 children and leaf nodes both should be at same level.
Balanced Tree:
For all the nodes( height of left subtree-height of right subtree) can be 0 or 1 then it is called as balanced tree.
A special tree called BINARY SEARCH TREE[BST]:
All the left side elements should be lesser than its parent and all the right side should be greater than its parent.
